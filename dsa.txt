Arrays

An array is a reference data type.

# Each variable is stored in a memory location, using RAM
# Each element in the list is converted into binary form.
# each single 1/0 is a bit. 8 bits make one byte.
# We use 4 bytes to an integer number.
# Each byte is stored in/on a memory location.

When looking by index:
The first element in the array has a particular memory address.
stock_prices[0] -> 0x00500
When we do index of 2, what happens is:
stock_prices[2] -> 0x00500 + 2*sizeof(integer(in bytes))

Because only one operation is performed, irresspective of the lists length or the objects position,
The Big O complexity is O(1). Constant time opearion.

When looking by value and not index:
you can run a simple for loop with a conditional statement. This will be O(n)

To print all prices:
Array traversal: Also O(n)

To add or remove an element at a certain position from an array, the big O complexity is O(n). 
This is because, the memory location for each element will have to change because of the distortion.

Static and dynamic arrays:
In static array, there is a specific size your array must be. You have a fixed size, and it will allocate memory only for that fixed size.


Linked Lists:
Unlike in an array where each memory location follows each other, here they can be placed in different locations, but, each element, has the memory location of the next element.

Insert/delete element at the beginning - O(1)
Insert/delete element at the end - O(n)


Dictionaries/Objects implement hash tables - This is the underlying data structure.
{'6-Mar': 310.0, '7-Mar': 340.0, '8-Mar': 380.0, '9-Mar': 302.0, '10-Mar': 297.0, '11-Mar': 323.0}
Consider the above. there will be a list of say, a fixed sixe. 
It will take march 6, and then map it to specific element in the list, 
and to get the index of that element in the list, we use a hash function.

The hash function is converting the string key into the index of an array.\

There are different ways of implementing hash function, one way is using ASCII numbers.

In hashmap, 
Lookup by key is O(1) on average
Insertion/Deletion is O(1) on average

Collisions in hashmaps
This occurs when two keys are trying to store the values at the same location.
To solve this, we can use chaining.
We can also use linear probing.
